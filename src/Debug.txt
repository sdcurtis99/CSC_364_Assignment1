Once pathfinding is already running dont allow start to be activated again until it is done
Path gets overwrote by visited nodes (grid 30), eventually path becomes solid and visited and path stop flipping
Upon reset pathing algorithm continues to keep searching, but start end, and the current grids that have been marked are cleared
Dont allow path finding algortihm to run while start and end are null,
Pause is non-functional
Sleep should be dyanmic based on grid size so that the speed of which the path is explored is appropiate to the size of the grid

All swing events, Ie Mouse Actions, Buttons, Etc should be threaded for improved performance.
